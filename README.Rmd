# arrowextendr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of arrow-extendr is to provide a Rust crate that integrates arrow-rs types with extendr and the `{arrow}` R package. It is based on the arrow-rs pyarrow feature. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of arrowextendr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JosiahParry/arrow-extendr")
```

These R functions illustrate that we can create arrow-rs structs and return them to R

```{r}
library(arrowextendr)

# i32 array
test_i32()

# f64 array
test_f64()

# fields
test_field()

# record batches
test_record_batch()
```
